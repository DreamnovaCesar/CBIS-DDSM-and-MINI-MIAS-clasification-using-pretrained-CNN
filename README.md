# CBIS-DDSM-and-MINI-MIAS-clasification-using-pretrained-CNN

This repo contains a concise Tensorflow implementation using CNN's models for classifying mammograms. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This section describes the data pre-processing steps used in this research, the data selection process, the data augmentation strategy, and the CNN architectures used for the classification tasks.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for processing data that has a grid-like structure, such as an image. It is particularly useful for image classification, object detection, and image generation tasks.

CNNs are composed of several layers of interconnected nodes, with each layer performing a specific operation on the input data. The first layer is the input layer, which takes in the raw image data. The next layer is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of filters to the input data to extract features. These features are then passed through a pooling layer, which reduces the dimensionality of the data by summarizing the extracted features in a fixed-size window. This process is repeated with multiple convolutional and pooling layers until the final layers, which are fully connected and classify the input data into one of the predefined categories.

## Setup

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

To create a virtual environment with TensorFlow using Anaconda, follow these steps:

Open the Anaconda Prompt by clicking the Start button and typing "Anaconda Prompt".
Type the following command to create a new virtual environment called "tfenv":

```bash
conda create --name tfenv
```

Activate the virtual environment by typing:

```bash
conda activate tfenv
```

Finally, install requirements.txt.

```bash
conda install requirements.txt
```

## GPU setup

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
